# rosalind-solutions

I am solving the problems on [https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/](Rosalind) in C because I ...... am trying to be a REAL PROGRAMMER! No, I think it's because a lot of the solutions on the web and on the site itself seems to be in Python. I don't want to learn Perl (The old Bioinformaticsy language) and I have my qualms with Rust (you never know I might just start to again). Besides nothing is implemented in C like not even a basic hashmap. I kind of like it. 

I am not responsible for these programs. If stuff happens because I have forgotten to free memory or you get trauma from reading my horrible comments and code I warned you. The code is structured in folders with a common.c and common.h file thing at the top, but whatever I think I will fix stuff overtime as I lay into more problems. I might add more and more instructions in the form of README files but let's see.
